# Skincraft

A modern fork of the in-browser skin editor for Minecraft!

Originally built in ActionScript for use with Flash, I had the idea of trying to rebuild the app from scratch using modern web tech available today! While there are more advanced editors available out there that you can already go use, I want to rework this project because it was a very big part of my early Minecraft days, and I think it would be a fun thing to do in general!

Since this will likely take a while to complete, I think it will be a side project that I work on here and there. I'm going to have to learn about the Flash app folder structure, as it's completely new to me.
